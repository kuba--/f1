# F1
F1 is a car racing game made in [Godot](https://godotengine.org) v3.5. The idea was inspired by [Simple 2D car steering physics in games](https://engineeringdotnet.blogspot.com/2010/04/simple-2d-car-physics-in-games.html) blog post, but also by multiple articles on [Godot Recipes](https://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/3.x/) website:
- 3D Kinematic Car
- Car steering
- Context-based steering
